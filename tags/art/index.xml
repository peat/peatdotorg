      <description>My mom is an artist, and I grew up so deeply immersed in art that it almost felt like drowning &amp;ndash; submerged in gallery openings, endless museums, sitting for portraits, the ever present scent of gesso and turpentine. By the time I left home I was burnt out on the abstract, the metaphorical, and the allegorical. I was thoroughly jaded &amp;ndash; why waste time on such things when there were &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; problems to solve?</description>
