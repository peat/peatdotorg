      <description>My mom is an artist, and I grew up so deeply immersed in art that it almost felt like drowning &amp;ndash; submerged in gallery openings, endless museums, sitting for portraits, the ever present scent of gesso and turpentine. By the time I left home I was burnt out on the abstract, the metaphorical, and the allegorical. I was thoroughly jaded &amp;ndash; why waste time on such things when there were &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; problems to solve?</description>

      <description>I was in third grade when I saw international currency for the first time. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered that money from other places might be different than the US Dollar, and it was a delightful shock when my mom showed me a French banknote. The style! The color! It was gorgeous.
Check out the Costa Rican money above. The design is wonderful, the printing intricate and precise. More details emerge the closer you look &amp;ndash; check out the multicolored fibers in the paper to prevent counterfeiting!</description>

      <description>If I&amp;rsquo;m going to yell into the void, I might as well do it in style!
I&amp;rsquo;m rebooting peat.org with a fresh stack: using the Hugo static site generator, Tailwind CSS framework, and GitHub Pages for hosting. So far so good! I&amp;rsquo;m learning heaps about Hugo and Tailwind. The theme was built from scratch, so hassle me if you see something wonky.
&amp;ldquo;I built it from scratch&amp;rdquo; will be a recurring theme on this site.</description>
